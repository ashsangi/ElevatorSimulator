# ElevatorSimulator
This project is an elevator simulator that uses polymorphism and object-oriented programming to
simulate the movement of elevators in a building with multiple types of passengers and elevators.
The system has 8 elevators, each of which can be one of 4 types of elevators, with a certain
percentage of requests for each type. Similarly, each passenger can be one of 4 types, with a
different percentage of requests for each type.
